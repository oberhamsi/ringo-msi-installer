my first attempt at creating a .msi

ringojs-frag.wxs was created with heat.exe - sadly i didn't record the exact command i used.

what this does is:

  * copy ringojs-0.10 files
  * ringo-admin install rp
  * rp install --global ringo-virtue
  * adds RINGO_HOME\bin to %PATH% environment variable

ringo-virtue is a meta package

compile
=========

requires wixtoolset

    candle ringo-frag.wxs ringo.wxs
    light wix.wsx.wixobj ringojs.wixobj -ext WixUtilExtension -out ringojs.msi
 

test:

    ringojs.msi /l* ringo-install.log
